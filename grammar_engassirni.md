    - nasal + voiced obstruent of the same place
    - s + voiceless stop
    - fricative + stop of the same place and voice.
    - All of above plus some approximant.
- Complex coda can only be at most approximant + valid obstruent/nasal.
- Onset and coda cannot contain approximant at the same time.

## Morphology

- Noun declines by case and number.  
  Genitive case usually ends with nasal, objective case has longer vowel and usually ends with fricative, and plural is indicated by retracting the vowel.
- Adjective does not decline to the noun.
- Verbs are conjugated by tense, that is, past "da-" and future "go-"
