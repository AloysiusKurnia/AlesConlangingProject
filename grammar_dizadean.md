- Coda can be any consonant.
- Onset cannot contain ⟨'⟩ and ⟨ng⟩.
- Onset that consists of purely stop can geminate. If so, the previous voice must be a vowel.
- These are the only allowed complex onset. Note that "any stop" excludes ⟨'⟩.
    - ⟨s⟩ + any stop [sb, sd, sg],
    - any stop + ⟨z⟩ [bz, dz, gz],
    - any stop + any approximant [bw, dw, gw, bj, dj, gj],
    - any stop + ⟨r⟩ [br, dr, gr].

## Sample Sentence

**The North Wind and the Sun**

The North Wind and the Sun were disputing which was the stronger, when a traveler came along wrapped in a warm cloak. They agreed that the one who first succeeded in making the traveler take his cloak off should be considered stronger than the other. Then the North Wind blew as hard as he could, but the more he blew the more closely did the traveler fold his cloak around him.
